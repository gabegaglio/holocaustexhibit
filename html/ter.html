                    <p><strong class="section">Establishment </strong>The SS established the Theresienstadt Ghetto in the town of Terez√≠n from <strong>1941-1945 </strong> during World War II. 
                    It served as a temporary stop for prisoners on their way to extermination camps. 
                    The living conditions in Theresienstadt were intentionally designed to expedite the death of its inmates, and was also used for propaganda purposes to decieve the Red Cross into thinking these concentration camps were safe. 
                    Unlike other ghettos, forced labor was not a significant economic factor.

                    Towards the end of the war, prisoners from various nationalities were also sent to Theresienstadt.</p>

                    <p><strong class="section">Casualties </strong>Approximately <strong>33,000</strong> people died in the ghetto due to malnutrition and disease. 
                    Over <strong>88,000</strong> individuals were held there for extended periods before being deported to extermination camps and other killing sites. 
                    The involvement of the Jewish Council in selecting individuals for deportation has been a subject of controversy. 
                    The total number of survivors was around <strong>23,000</strong>, including <strong>4,000</strong> deportees who managed to survive.</p>
