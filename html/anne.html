                    She lived under her parents Otto and Edith and older sister Margot. In <strong>1934</strong>, she moved to the city of Amsterdam, Netherlands due to the anti-semitism present in Germany. 
                    In <strong>May 1940 </strong> the Nazi's invaded the Netherlands, forcing Anne to a seperate Jewish school. A year later in <strong>1941 </strong> the Star of David was implemented by the Nazis to be worn.

On her 13th birthday, <strong>June 1942</strong>, just a month before they went into hiding, she recieved a diary which contained her documented first hand accounts of her experiences and time in hiding for 2 years <strong>(1942-1944)</strong>.
                        The diary contained all that came across her mind and serves as a insight to what those forced into hiding felt on a daily basis.
