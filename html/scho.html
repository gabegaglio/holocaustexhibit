                        <strong class="section">Early Life </strong>
                        Arnold Schoenberg was born in Vienna, Austria in <strong>1874</strong> and was a music theorist, composer, and painter.
                        He started learning music at the age of 8 and was mostly self-taught.
                        In his early twenties, Schoenberg orchestrated operettas and composed his own works and became recognized as a significant composer by Richard Strauss and Gustav Mahler.
                        Although he did not practice Judaism, he was still targeted by the Nazi party because of his Jewish ancestry with his music labeled as 'degenerate'.

                        <strong class="section">Atonality </strong>
                        He originally had a Romantic era composition style but
                        as a music theorist, experimented with the idea of atonal music.
                        Thus, he eventually developed the twelve-tone method which involves all 12 notes of the chromatic scale, or rather all 12 notes were treated as equals,
                        meaning the music did not have a specific key or tonal center.

                        <strong class="section">United States </strong>
                        Because of his Jewish heritage, Schoenberg decided to move to the United States in <strong>1933 </strong> when Hitler came to power. 
                        He lived in Boston and then Los Angeles and stayed in the United States for the rest of his life.
                        He made numerous works, of that include a dedicated composition to the survivors of Warsaw titled 'A Survivor From Warsaw' in <strong>1947</strong>.
